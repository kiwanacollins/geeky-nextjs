## Introduction

Geeky Nextjs respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of our services to do the same.

## Reporting Copyright Infringement

If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied and is accessible on our website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify us by providing the following information:

### Required Information for DMCA Notice

1. **Identification of the copyrighted work** claimed to have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.

2. **Identification of the material** that is claimed to be infringing and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (e.g., URL of the specific page).

3. **Contact information** for the complaining party, including:
   - Full name
   - Address

4. **A statement** that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

3. **Provide the user** with a copy of the DMCA notice
4. **Inform the user** of their right to submit a counter-notification

## Counter-Notification Process

If you believe that material you posted was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may submit a counter-notification containing the following information:

### Required Information for Counter-Notification

## Repeat Infringer Policy

We reserve the right to terminate users who are found to be repeat infringers. A repeat infringer is someone who has been the subject of more than one valid DMCA takedown notice.

## False Claims

Before submitting a DMCA notice, please consider whether the use of copyrighted material may qualify as fair use. Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material for purposes such as:
- Criticism and comment
- News reporting
- Teaching and education
- Research
- Parody
